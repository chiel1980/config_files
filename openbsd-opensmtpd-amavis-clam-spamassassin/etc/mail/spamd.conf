# spamd(8) configuration file, read by spamd-setup(8).
# See also spamd.conf(5).
#
# Configures lists for spamd(8).
#
# Strings follow getcap(3) convention escapes, except you
# can have a bare colon (:) inside a quoted string and it
# will deal with it. See spamd-setup(8) for more details.
#
# "all" must be here, and defines the order in which lists are applied.
# Lists specified with the :white: capability apply to the previous
# list with a :black: capability.
#
# As of June 2016, a place to search for blacklists is
#     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_blacklists
# - most of these are DNS-based only and cannot be used with spamd(8),
# but some of the lists also provide access to text files via rsync.
